# EmployeeManage
Employee Management System Project with React.js & MySql

In today's business world, companies often have hundreds or even thousands of employees. Additionally, these large companies are constantly growing. New departments are established, new job positions are created. This rapid growth process makes the work more complex and increases the number of employees. This also makes it difficult to track employees. With such a large workforce, difficulties and complexities can arise in managing work, tracking employees, and managing their performance.

This project is designed to overcome these difficulties.

The main aim of the project is to provide a platform where the user can view the employees in their own team, add new employees to their team, remove existing employees from their team, and update employee data. Access permissions and rights necessary to perform these operations have been granted only to team leaders to prevent possible complexities.

Team leaders, when they log into the platform, will not only be able to make updates related to their own teams but also access detailed information about other employees and teams in the company. This way, managers can both manage their own teams and have a better understanding of the overall structure of the company.

This project aims to make employee management more efficient and optimize business processes. It also aims to improve teamwork and information flow among employees, strengthening internal communication.
